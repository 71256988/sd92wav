# sd92wav
This is a simple Python script to convert Bemani .sd9 audio files to .wav. Unlike the existing utility you don't need to fumble around with compilers.

No other requirements than any version of Python 3.

An SD9 file is essentially just a wav file with 32 bytes of game metadata header in front of it.
